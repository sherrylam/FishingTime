## Fishing Time for P5.js
#### by Sherry Lam


### Overview
This is an interactive fishing experience. You get to wait for a fish to bite onto your bait, and once you reel in, you get a random fish. Be sure to look at the regulations to know which fish you can keep.


### Technical Details
This project includes drawing shapes, loading images, for loops, conditionals, state machines, interactivity using the mouse and keyboard, timers, etc. 

This is a state machine going through a fishing experience. There are 10 states in total. It is non-linear so you can only get to a certain state by going in a particular path. It is restricted by if statements. Each state can change by a click of the mouse, a click on a certain area of the screen, or a keyboard input. 

I roughly based the fishes and the regulations on the California Freshwater Sport Fishing Regulations: https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=177572&inline
